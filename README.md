# national_address_database

I extracted into a csv format, addresses from the [National Address Database](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/open/gis/national-address-database/national-address-database-nad-disclaimer)

## Potentially useful for next steps?
- [Schema for the national address database](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/mission/gis/national-address-database/308816/nad-schema-v1.pdf)
- [API to reverse long lat into area information](https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/#!/area/get_area)
